Type Casting:
	Type casting is converting one data type to another one.
	For example we can convert a short to bye a long to float etc.
	There are 2 main types implicit/widening/automatic and explicit/narrowing/manual
Implicit /widening/automatic:
	WHEN JAVA CONVERTS THE DAtA TYPES AUTOMATICALLY for us. It only happens when w assigning a smaller data type to a larger data type, 
	bc there is no data loss in this conversion.
	
Explicit/narrowing/Manual type casting:
	When we convert larger data type to a smaller data type it is called Explicit/narrowing/Manual.It doesnt happen automatically we 
	have to do it explicitly manually
Why we should learn type casting?
	When we write code in our real life, most of the time we use the code from others to save time and we might also need to convert 
	the data types to make our code compatible with their code
What is the syntax for type casting?
	we is ( and inside the () we write the destination data type 
	for example if we want to convert a long to an int this is how we do it.
	long var1=250;
	int var2=(int)var1; //its Explicit/narrowing/manual
	double var3=var2 //implicit/widening/automatic
	
	float f=250.5f;
	double d=f;// Implicit/widening/automatic
	
	
If else conditions
	If else conditions help us write code that can take the decision based on data.
Why we should learn about if else?
	Bc when we are solving a real life problem like testing a website our program needs to make a lot of decisions.
	IF (the given username & password matches)
	{go to home page} ELSE {give user a warning}
What is the syntax for If else conditions
	boolean isHungrry=true;
	
	if(isHungry){
	
	}
	
Nested if conditions:
